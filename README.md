# Seismologist
Seismology has witnessed significant advancements in recent years with the application of deep learning methods to address a broad range of problems. My research group seeks to apply novel Deep Learning and Machine Learning based algorithms on seismic signals to improve Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWs) and Seismic Signal Analysis. Additionally, by implementing distinct Artificial Intelligence-driven models, High Performance Computing and supported by the statistical analysis based on classical models we are also trying to better understand the pattern associated with Seismic stress release.

## Research Projects
### Seismic Signal Analysis using Deep Learning for single station
My team has developed an open-source Python package - **SAIPy** for fast seismic waveform data processing by implementing deep learning. SAIPy is an open-source python library where we strive to combine our previously published models into an automated pipeline for monitoring continuous seismic data so that it can be easily implemented by seismologists. It offers solutions for multiple seismological tasks such as earthquake detection, magnitude estimation, seismic phase picking, and polarity identification.

### Earthquake Forecasting
Reliable earthquake forecasting methods have long been sought after, and so the rise of modern data science techniques raises a new question: does deep learning have the potential to learn this pattern? In this study, we leverage the large amount of earthquakes reported via good seismic station coverage in the subduction zone of Japan. We pose earthquake forecasting as a classification problem and train a Deep Learning Network to decide, whether a timeseries of length ≥ 2 years will end in an earthquake on the following day with magnitude ≥ 5 or not.
