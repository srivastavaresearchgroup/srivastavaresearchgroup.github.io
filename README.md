I am a **Geophysicist** and **AI researcher** specializing in the application of **deep learning**, **machine learning** and **high performance computing** with over 6 years of experience applying machine learning to large-scale seismic and geospatial data. My work integrates deep learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow), signal processing, and time series analysis to tackle high-impact problems in seismology and natural hazard forecasting. I’ve led the development of two open-source Python packages [AWESAM](https://github.com/srivastavaresearchgroup/AWESAM) and [SAIPy](https://github.com/srivastavaresearchgroup/SAIPy) in collaboration with my team. and securing approximately €2 million in research funding to advance AI-driven seismic analysis. I’ve secured more than €2 million in competitive research funding, mentored PhD students and postdocs, and delivered workshops to both academic and government stakeholders across the geoscience and disaster response communities.

## Research Projects
### **SAIPy** - An open source python package for Earthquake Monitoring using deep learning
We have developed an open-source Python package - **SAIPy** for fast seismic waveform data processing by implementing deep learning. [SAIPy](https://github.com/srivastavaresearchgroup/SAIPy) is an open-source python library where we strive to combine our previously published models into an automated pipeline for monitoring continuous seismic data so that it can be easily implemented by seismologists. It offers solutions for multiple seismological tasks such as earthquake detection, magnitude estimation, seismic phase picking, and polarity identification.

### Earthquake Forecasting
Reliable earthquake forecasting methods have long been sought after, and so the rise of modern data science techniques raises a new question: does deep learning have the potential to learn this pattern? In this study, we leverage the large amount of earthquakes reported via good seismic station coverage in the subduction zone of Japan. We pose earthquake forecasting as a classification problem and train a Deep Learning Network to decide, whether a timeseries of length ≥ 2 years will end in an earthquake on the following day with magnitude ≥ 5 or not.

### High magnitude event detection in HR-GNSS data using deep learning

High-rate Global Navigation Satellite System (HR-GNSS) data can be highly useful for earthquake analysis as it provides continuous high-rate measurements of ground motion. In this project, we are attempting to identify high magnitude event and estimate the magnitude using HR-GNSS displacement time series.

### **AWESAM** - Seismo-Volcanic event Analysis

Many active volcanoes exhibit Strombolian activity, which is typically characterized by relatively frequent mild volcanic explosions and also by rare and much more destructive major explosions and paroxysms. Catalogs of these eruptions and, specifically, seismo-volcanic events may be generated using continuous seismic recordings at stations in the proximity of volcanoes. We developed an automated user-friendly, time-saving, automated approach via a python package labelled as: the Adaptive-Window Volcanic Event Selection Analysis Module ([AWESAM](https://github.com/srivastavaresearchgroup/AWESAM)). The strength of the python package is the reliable detection of very small and frequent events as well as major explosions and paroxysms. We applied AWESAM to seismic data from Stromboli (Italy), Mount Etna (Italy), Yasur (Vanuatu) and Whakaari (New Zealand) and performed an inter-event time analysis to identify characteristic patterns in the events' recurrence time and the volcanic activity.
